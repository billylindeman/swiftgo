##Goroutines implemented in Apple Swift 

This is a small example of using trailing closures, custom operators, and generics in swift.

I've implemented a very basic version of the "go" keyword from golang, as well as the typed channel interface

DISCLAIMER: 
Don't actually use this for anything.  I wrote this on the plane ride back from WWDC out of curiosity and boredom.

TODO:
Is it possible to implement the select keyword from golang?
